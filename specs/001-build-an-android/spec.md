# Feature Specification: New Calendar Event Notifier

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-android`
**Created**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build an android application that subscribes for all calendar updates (and uses polling every 15 minutes). It should keep track of "seen calendar events", and generate a notification to the user when a new/future calendar event appears in the synced calendars on the device. That noficication should contain the calendar event title, time, date and the calendar it was discovered on. Once an event is detected, it's status of "seen" should be persisted in a local databse. The UI for the app should offer feature showing all of the calendars synched to the device (their name, and using the color of the calendar) allowing the user to toggle whether a calendar should be considered for this process. Clicking on the notification should launch the Google Calendar app to the event."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to be notified of new calendar events from my selected calendars so that I don't miss important appointments or activities.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application is installed and has calendar access, **When** a new event is created in a calendar that is being monitored, **Then** the user receives a notification displaying the event's title, time, date, and the calendar it belongs to.
2. **Given** the user opens the application, **When** they navigate to the calendar list, **Then** they see a list of all calendars synced to the device, each with its name, color, and a toggle to enable or disable monitoring.
3. **Given** a notification for a new event is displayed, **When** the user clicks on the notification, **Then** the Google Calendar app is opened to the corresponding event details.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a calendar is deleted from the device? Nothing
- How does the system handle an event that is updated instead of created? Nothing
- What happens if the device is offline for an extended period? App should only notify about new events that appear in the future, and mark non-future events as "seen" even if they appear as new.
- How are all-day events handled? Should not matter, app should notify the user when it sees a new all day event in the future. Notification should state that it is an all day event, instead of the time.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST scan for calendar events every 15 minutes.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST persist the "seen" status of calendar events in a local database.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST generate a notification when a new, future event is detected in a monitored calendar.
- **FR-004**: The notification MUST contain the event title, start time, start date, and the name of the calendar.
- **FR-005**: The UI MUST display a list of all calendars available on the device.
- **FR-006**: Each item in the calendar list MUST show the calendar's name and its display color.
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to enable or disable monitoring for each calendar individually.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST only send notifications for events from calendars that are enabled by the user.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST request permission to read calendar data.
- **FR-010**: Clicking on the notification MUST launch the Google Calendar app to the event.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Calendar**: Represents a calendar on the device. It has a name, a color, and a user-defined setting for whether it should be monitored.
- **Event**: Represents a single event from a calendar. It has a title, start time, end time, and a status indicating if it has been "seen" by the notification system.
