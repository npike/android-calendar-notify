# Research Findings

## 1. Efficient Android Calendar Provider queries for a date range

### Decision
Utilize `CalendarContract.Instances` for querying calendar events within a specified date range.

### Rationale
`CalendarContract.Instances` is optimized for handling recurring events and their exceptions, providing a flattened view of event occurrences. This is the most efficient method for date-range-based event retrieval.

### Alternatives Considered
Directly querying `CalendarContract.Events` would require manual handling of recurring events and exceptions, leading to increased complexity and potential inefficiencies.

## 2. Best practices for persistent feature flags/status in Android

### Decision
Use Jetpack DataStore (specifically Preferences DataStore) for managing persistent feature flags and the "initial setup complete" status.

### Rationale
DataStore is designed for small, simple key-value data, offers an asynchronous and main-thread safe API using Kotlin Coroutines and Flow, and is the modern replacement for SharedPreferences. It provides reactive updates, which is beneficial for UI state.

### Alternatives Considered
Room was considered but deemed overkill for simple key-value storage, introducing unnecessary boilerplate and complexity. SharedPreferences was rejected due to its synchronous API and lack of transactional safety.

## 3. Creating non-dismissible foreground service notifications in Android WorkManager

### Decision
Implement non-dismissible foreground service notifications by combining WorkManager's `setForeground` method with specific Notification settings: `setOngoing(true)` and `setOnlyAlertOnce(true)`.

### Rationale
This approach ensures the notification remains visible and cannot be dismissed by the user, indicating an ongoing background task. It leverages WorkManager's capabilities for deferrable background work while providing the necessary user awareness for long-running operations.

### Alternatives Considered
Standard notifications are dismissible and would not meet the requirement for a persistent indicator during background setup. Direct Foreground Service implementation without WorkManager would require more manual management of the service lifecycle.

## 4. Android Compose UI patterns for a loading/setup screen

### Decision
For the setup screen, use a `sealed class` for UI state management (`Loading`, `Success`, `Error`) exposed via a `StateFlow` from the `ViewModel`. Display a `CircularProgressIndicator` for basic loading feedback. For multi-step setup, leverage Jetpack Compose Navigation.

### Rationale
This pattern provides a clear, organized, and reactive way to manage the UI state of the setup screen. `CircularProgressIndicator` offers a standard and recognizable loading animation. Jetpack Compose Navigation is suitable for managing transitions between different steps of a setup process.

### Alternatives Considered
Shimmer/Skeleton loading was considered for perceived performance but might be an over-complication for a simple setup screen. Custom animations were deemed unnecessary for the initial implementation. Direct state management without `sealed class` or `StateFlow` would lead to less organized and harder-to-maintain UI logic.
